UBOS beta 13 is out, and there are lots of new things. Here are some of the highlights:

* UBOS can now easily run Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero daemons. This is great for
  development of blockchain-related applications, and for those users who'd like to
  connect their cryptocurrency wallets to servers they control.

* WiFi configuration has become really simple, by means of the UBOS Staff USB stick:
  save a file with your WiFi network name and credentials to your UBOS Staff, and next
  time you boot your device, UBOS will automatically connect to your WiFi network.

* UBOS now supports UEFI-only PCs, such as the Intel Compute Stick (probably the
  cheapest way to run UBOS on PC hardware).
