Info section
------------

The info section in a :doc:`../ubos-manifest` is optional but recommended. It contains user-friendly, localized
information about the :term:`App` or :term:`Accessory`. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: json

   "info" : {
     "en_US" : {
       "name" : "Glad I Was Here",
       "tagline" : "Best guestbook evar"
     },
     "de" : {
       "name" : "Gerne hier gewesen",
       "tagline" : "Das allerbeste GÃ¤stebuch"
     },
     "default" : {
       "name" : "Glad I Was Here",
       "tagline" : "Best guestbook evar"
     }
   }

Below the ``info`` tag, the ``name`` and ``tagline`` fields are grouped by locale. A locale:

* may have two components, such as ``en_US``, or ``fr_FR`` (language, underscore, country)
* may have one component, such as ``de`` (language)
* or be the special value ``default``, which is used if no more appropriate locale
  can be found.

``name`` is a user-friendly name for the :term:`App` or :term:`Accessory`.

``tagline`` is a single-line, short summary for the :term:`App` or :term:`Accessory` that reminds the
user what this :term:`App` or :term:`Accessory` is all about.
