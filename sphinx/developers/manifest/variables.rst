Variables available at deploy or undeploy
=========================================

When an app or accessory is deployed or undeployed, the involved scripts, templates
and the Manifest JSON may refer to certain symbolic names.

See also :doc:`functions`.

Commonly-used variables
-----------------------

The following symbolic names are currently defined and commonly used by developers when
packaging their apps or accessories for UBOS. They are listed alphabetically.

``${apache2.gname}``
   Name of the Linux group used for running the Apache web server.
   This is convenient for setting ownership of files.

   Example: ``http``

``${apache2.uname}``
   Name of the Linux user account used for running the Apache web server.
   This is convenient for setting ownership of files.

   Example: ``http``

``${appconfig.apache2.appconfigfragmentfile}``
   The name of the Apache2 configuration fragment which may be written
   by this app configuration.

   Example: ``/etc/httpd/ubos/appconfigs/s753ca4a344f56c38aad05172dee6a53f6647af62/a9f52884fef255d617981fb0a94916bf67bcf64b5.conf``

``${appconfig.apache2.dir}``
   The directory in which Apache requires this app configuration's web server files.
   No trailing slash.

   Example: ``/srv/http/sites/s753ca4a344f56c38aad05172dee6a53f6647af62/blog`` (if the app configuration
   is at relative path ``/blog`` on a site with siteid ``s753ca4a344f56c38aad05172dee6a53f6647af62``)

``${appconfig.appconfigid}``
   The identifier of the app configuration as specified in the site JSON file.

   Example: ``a9f52884fef255d617981fb0a94916bf67bcf64b5``

``${appconfig.context}``
   Context path for this app configuration as specified in the site JSON file
   (or, if not given, the default from the manifest JSON).
   No trailing slash. The root context is a zero-length string.

   Examples: ``/blog`` or (empty string)

``${appconfig.contextnoslashorroot}``
   Context path for this app configuration as specified in the site JSON file.
   (or, if not given, the default from the manifest JSON), but without either
   leading or trailing slash. If root context, the string is ``ROOT``.
   This variable makes some Tomcat configuration statements easier.

   Examples: ``blog`` or ``ROOT``

``${appconfig.contextorslash}``
   Context path for this app configuration as specified in the site JSON file.
   (or, if not given, the default from the manifest JSON).
   No trailing slash. However, the root context is a single slash.
   This variable makes some Apache configuration statements easier that
   usually take a context path without trailing slash, but require a single
   slash when the context path would otherwise be empty.

   Examples: ``/blog`` or ``/``

``${appconfig.cronjobfile}``
   If this app configuration needs to define one or more cron jobs, this is
   the preferred filename it should use for this purpose.

   Example: ``/etc/cron.d/50-a9f52884fef255d617981fb0a94916bf67bcf64b5``

``${appconfig.datadir}``
   A directory in which this app configuration should preferably store data (outside of
   the webserver's DocumentRoot). No trailing slash. While this variable is pre-defined,
   the app is responsible for actually creating the directory in its Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``/var/lib/wordpress/a9f52884fef255d617981fb0a94916bf67bcf64b5``

``${appconfig.mysql.dbhost.maindb}``
   Database host for the MySQL database whose symbolic name in the Manifest JSON is ``maindb``.
   Replace ``maindb`` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``localhost``

``${appconfig.mysql.dbname.maindb}``
   Actual name of the MySQL database whose symbolic name in the manifest JSON
   is ``maindb``. Replace ``maindb`` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``database477``

``${appconfig.mysql.dbport.maindb}``
   Database port for the MySQL database whose symbolic name in the Manifest JSON is ``maindb``.
   Replace ``maindb`` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``3306``

``${appconfig.mysql.dbuser.maindb}``
   Database user for the MySQL database whose symbolic name in the Manifest JSON is ``maindb``.
   Replace ``maindb`` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``fred``

``${appconfig.mysql.dbusercredential.maindb}``
   Database password for the MySQL database whose symbolic name in the Manifest JSON is ``maindb``.
   Replace ``maindb`` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``n0ts0s3cr3t``

``${appconfig.postgresql.dbhost.maindb}``
   Database host for the Postgresql database whose symbolic name in the Manifest JSON is ``maindb``.
   Replace ``maindb`` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``localhost``

``${appconfig.postgresql.dbname.maindb}``
   Actual name of the Postgresql database whose symbolic name in the Manifest JSON
   is ``maindb``. Replace ``maindb`` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``database477``

``${appconfig.postgresql.dbport.maindb}``
   Database port for the Postgresql database whose symbolic name in the Manifest JSON is ``maindb``.
   Replace ``maindb`` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``3306``

``${appconfig.postgresql.dbuser.maindb}``

   Example: ``fred``

``${appconfig.postgresql.dbusercredential.maindb}``
   Database password for the Postgresql database whose symbolic name in the Manifest JSON is ``maindb``.
   Replace ``maindb`` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``n0ts0s3cr3t``

``${appconfig.tcpport.someport}``
   The port number allocated for the TCP port whose symbolic port name in the Manifest JSON
   is ``someport`. Replace ``someport` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``5432``

``${appconfig.tomcat8.contextfile}``
   The name of the Tomcat8 context configuration file which may be written
   by this app configuration.

   Example: ``/etc/tomcat8/Catalina/example.com/ROOT.xml``

``${appconfig.tomcat8.dir}``
   The directory in which Tomcat requires this app configuration's application server
   files. No trailing slash.

   is ``someport`. Replace ``someport` with the symbolic name you used in the Manifest JSON.

   Example: ``5432``

``${host.tmpdir}``
   Name of a directory in which to create temporary files. By using this symbolic
   name, the location of temporarily files can be moved to a partition that has
   sufficient space (say ``/var/tmp`` vs ``/tmp``) without impacting apps.

   Example: ``/var/tmp``

``${hostname}``
   Name of the current host as returned by the OS. This is often
   different from ``${site.hostname}``, which is a virtual host name
   for a site.

   provided in the accessory's manifest to identify the app for which this is an accessory.

   Example: ``wordpress``

``${installable.accessoryinfo.accessoryid}``
   Only exists for accessories, not for apps. The value of the ``accessoryinfo`` / ``accessoryid``
   provided in the accessory's manifest to identify the name of the accessory from the
   perspective of the app, which may or may not be the same as the package name of the
   accessory in UBOS.

   Example: ``p2``

``${installable.accessoryinfo.accessorytype}``
   Only exists for accessories, not for apps. The value of the ``accessoryinfo`` / ``accessorytype``

   The value of customization point ``foo``
   for the app or accessory in this
   app configuration, as determined from the Manifest JSON file and the Site JSON file.

   Example: ``My daily musings``

``${site.hostname}``
   The virtual hostname of the site to which this app configuration
   belongs. This is often different from ``${hostname}``, which is
   the current host as returned by the OS.

   This variable will have value ``*`` for sites whose hostname was given
   as the wildcard.

    This is convenient for setting ownership of files.
