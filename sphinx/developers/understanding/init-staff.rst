``ubos-admin init-staff``
=========================

See also :doc:`../../users/ubos-admin`.

This command turns a USB device into a valid UBOS Staff, optionally saving information
provided as arguments to the command on the Staff device.

A heuristic is used to determine whether to reformat the USB device before writing to
it, so all existing information on it should assume to be lost.
