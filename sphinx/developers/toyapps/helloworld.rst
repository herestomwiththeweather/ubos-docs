Hello World
===========

Hello World is an extremely simple Web applications that that just displays Hello World
in a user's web browser.
We use it to give you a taste for what is involved to package a real web application
for UBOS. Here is a complete :-) screen shot:

To obtain the source code:

.. code-block:: none

   > git clone https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-toyapps

Go to subdirectory ``helloworld``.

Package lifecycle and app deployment
------------------------------------

The first thing to understand about how UBOS apps are packaged and deployed is the
lifecycle of a package from the developer's perspective, and then how a user deploys
and undeploys the app contained in the package:

#. The developer creates the files for the package. If you have cloned the git repository above,
   you find the files for ``helloworld`` in directory ``helloworld``; or you can browse
   them `on github <https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-toyapps/tree/master/helloworld>`_. They are,
   in alphabetical sequence:

   * ``appicons``: icon files (optional)
   * ``PKGBUILD``: package build script with some package meta-data (see below)
   * ``htaccess``: Apache configuration file that makes Apache default to ``index.php`` when
     the app is installed
   * ``index.php``: minimalistic PHP file printing "Hello World"
   * ``ubos-manifest.json``: UBOS meta-data file (see below)

#. The developer creates the package. In its root directory:

   .. code-block:: none

      > makepkg -f

   This will create the package file named ``helloworld-*-any.pkg.tar.xz`` (where
   ``*`` is a particular version number defined in the ``PKGBUILD`` file).
   ``makepkg`` is the packaging command for ``pacman`` packages, the types of
   packages we use in UBOS.

#. The developer makes the package available to the user. In the general case, this involves
   uploading the package to the UBOS depot, UBOS quality assurance etc etc, but for our purposes
   here, ignore all that and simply assume that the package file created by the developer
   has somehow arrived on the user's UBOS device.

#. The user installs the package. This only dumps the files in the package on the
   hard drive, it does not install the app at any virtual host:

   .. code-block:: none

      > sudo pacman -U helloworld-*-any.pkg.tar.xz

   This command will install a locally built package locally, but it is equivalent to
   what happens when a user obtains the same app via the UBOS :term:`Depot`.

#. The user installs this web app at a particular virtual host:

   .. code-block:: none

      > sudo ubos-admin createsite

   (See also :doc:`/users/firstsite`: use the app name ``helloworld``
   instead of ``wordpress``)

   This will put all the right files in the right web server directories, activate
   needed Apache modules, restart servers, and the like. When this command completes,
   the app is ready for use.

#. Now assume that a new version of the package is available. If the new package is available
   locally, the user can perform a software upgrade of the ``helloworld`` package (only):

   .. code-block:: none

      > sudo ubos-admin update --pkgfile <pkgfile>

   where ``<pkgfile>`` is a new version of the package file created as shown above.
   If distributed through the UBOS :term:`Depot`, the argument ``--pkgfile`` will be
   omitted, and UBOS will upgrade all software on the host to the most recent version.

#. Undeploy the app by undeployed the entire virtual host. This will keeps the
   package installed:

   .. code-block:: none

      > sudo ubos-admin undeploy --siteid <siteid>

   where ``<siteid>`` is the identifier of the installed site.

#. If the user wishes to remove the package entirely:

   .. code-block:: none

      > sudo pacman -R helloworld

Anatomy of the package
----------------------

The ``PKGBUILD`` script's ``package`` method puts the package together:

.. code-block:: none

   package() {
   # Manifest
       mkdir -p $pkgdir/var/lib/ubos/manifests
       install -m0644 $startdir/ubos-manifest.json $pkgdir/var/lib/ubos/manifests/${pkgname}.json
   # Icons
       mkdir -p $pkgdir/srv/http/_appicons/$pkgname
       install -m644 $startdir/appicons/{72x72,144x144}.png $pkgdir/srv/http/_appicons/$pkgname/
       install -m644 $startdir/appicons/license.txt $pkgdir/srv/http/_appicons/$pkgname/
   # Code
       mkdir -p $pkgdir/usr/share/${pkgname}
       install -m755 $startdir/index.php $pkgdir/usr/share/${pkgname}/
       install -m644 $startdir/htaccess $pkgdir/usr/share/${pkgname}/
   }

You can see that this script creates three directories, and installs a few files in them.
The Arch Linux wiki
`describes PKGBUILD <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Creating_packages>`_;
there is nothing UBOS-specific about this.

This corresponds to what the package file contains after ``makepkg`` has completed:

.. code-block:: none

   > tar tfJ helloworld-*-any.pkg.tar.xz
   .PKGINFO
   .MTREE
   srv/
   srv/http/
   srv/http/_appicons/
   srv/http/_appicons/helloworld/
   srv/http/_appicons/helloworld/72x72.png
   srv/http/_appicons/helloworld/144x144.png
   srv/http/_appicons/helloworld/license.txt
   usr/
   usr/share/
   usr/share/helloworld/
   usr/share/helloworld/index.php
   usr/share/helloworld/htaccess
   var/
   var/lib/
   var/lib/ubos/
   var/lib/ubos/manifests/
   var/lib/ubos/manifests/helloworld.json

.. image:: /images/helloworld-icon.png
   :class: right

The first two files, ``.PKGINFO`` and ``.MTREE`` are metadata that is automatically
generated by ``makepkg``.

Then, the files below ``srv/http/_appicons/`` are simply graphics files that can be used
by UBOS to show to the user a logo for the application. This image is shown to the right.
They are optional and are added in the ``package()`` section of ``PGKBUILD``.

``usr/share/helloworld`` contains the files that constitute the application. For this
extremely simple app, there are only two: the PHP code that emits the "Hello World" HTML,
and an Apache ``htaccess`` file so this HTML is emitted even if the path ends with a slash.
More complex web apps would put the bulk of their code and auxiliary files there.

Finally, ``var/lib/ubos/manifests/`` contains the :term:`UBOS Manifest JSON` file for this
application, which describes what needs to happen upon ``ubos-admin deploy`` and when
other ``ubos-admin`` commands are executed.

App manifest
------------

For this app, the manifest file looks as follows:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "type" : "app",

     "roles" : {
       "apache2" : {
         "defaultcontext" : "/hello",
         "depends" : [
           "php",
           "php-apache"
         ],
         "apache2modules" : [
           "php7"
         ],
         "appconfigitems" : [
           {
             "type"         : "file",
             "name"         : "index.php",
             "source"       : "index.php",
           },
           {
             "type"         : "file",
             "name"         : ".htaccess",
             "source"       : "htaccess",
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }

Let's discuss these items in sequence:

* ``"type" : "app"`` declares this to be an app, not an accessory.

* This app only uses a single role: ``apache2``. Apps could also specify other roles,
  such as ``mysql`` if they make use of MySQL in addition to Apache.

* By default, this app wants to be deployed at the relative path ``/hello`` of a
  virtual host. This can be overridden by the user in the :term:`Site JSON` file.

* For the ``apache2`` role, this app requires packages ``php`` and ``php-apache``, as it
  is a PHP app. It requires that the Apache module ``php7`` has been enabled before it
  can be run.

* Finally, each installation of this app requires two files to be installed in the
  web server's document directory tree: a file called ``index.php``, which is simply copied,
  and a file called ``.htaccess`` which is copied from a slightly different name. By
  convention, the "source" path is relative to the package installation directory
  ``/usr/share/helloworld``; and the destination path is relative to the correct directory
  from which Apache serves files, given the virtual host and context at which the app runs.
  Here, this may be ``/srv/http/sites/sa6e789f5d919c464d2422f6620eaf9cba789c4a5/hello/``
  (auto-provisioned by UBOS).

When the user invokes ``ubos-admin deploy``, UBOS processes the manifest and "makes it so".
It may be an interesting exercise for developers to install ``helloworld`` with the
example commands above, and to examine how UBOS made the app appear.

When the user invokes ``ubos-admin undeploy``, UBOS processes the manifest in reverse
sequence, and restores the system to its previous state.
